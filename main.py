# Tumor descriptions
glioma_tumor = """Gliomas are a type of tumor that originates in the glial cells of the brain or spinal cord. They can vary in severity from benign to malignant. Gliomas are categorized based on the type of glial cell they affect, such as astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, or ependymal cells. Symptoms of gliomas may include headaches, seizures, nausea, and changes in cognitive function. Diagnosis often involves imaging tests like MRI or CT scans, followed by biopsy for confirmation. Treatment options depend on the type, location, and grade of the tumor and may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or targeted therapy. Prognosis varies widely and depends on factors like tumor grade, size, and location. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive and common type of malignant glioma, with a particularly poor prognosis. Research into new treatments and therapies for gliomas is ongoing to improve outcomes for patients."""

meningioma_tumor = """Meningiomas are typically slow-growing tumors that originate in the meninges, the protective membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. They are often benign, but can occasionally be malignant. Meningiomas are more common in women and tend to occur in older individuals. Symptoms of meningiomas vary depending on their size and location but may include headaches, seizures, changes in vision or hearing, and focal neurological deficits. Diagnosis usually involves imaging tests like MRI or CT scans, followed by biopsy for confirmation. Treatment options for meningiomas include observation, surgery, radiation therapy, and sometimes chemotherapy. The prognosis for meningiomas is generally favorable, especially for benign tumors that can be completely surgically removed. However, the recurrence rate varies depending on factors such as tumor grade and completeness of resection. Ongoing research aims to improve understanding of meningiomas and develop more effective treatments."""

no_tumor = """Congratulations on your clear scan! Your recent brain image analysis did not detect any signs of a tumor. This is great news and a positive step towards ensuring your continued health and well-being.
While this result is reassuring, itâ€™s important to maintain regular health check-ups and consult with your healthcare provider for any concerns or symptoms you may experience. Remember, early detection and prevention are key to managing your health effectively.
If you have any questions or need further assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out to your medical professional. Stay healthy and take care!"""

pituitary_tumor = """Pituitary tumors are growths that develop in the pituitary gland, a pea-sized gland located at the base of the brain. They can be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) and are classified based on their size and hormone-secreting properties. Symptoms of pituitary tumors may include headaches, vision problems, hormonal imbalances leading to issues like abnormal growth, infertility, and changes in menstrual cycles. Diagnosis typically involves imaging tests like MRI or CT scans, along with hormone level assessments. Treatment options for pituitary tumors depend on factors such as tumor size, type, and symptoms, and may include medication, surgery, radiation therapy, or a combination of these approaches. Prognosis for pituitary tumors is generally favorable, especially for benign tumors that are effectively managed. However, some tumors may require ongoing monitoring and treatment. Research continues to improve understanding and treatment outcomes for pituitary tumors."""
